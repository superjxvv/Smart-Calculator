  <p>Bryce is looking for a new girlfriend in a dating app. Bryce&nbsp;believes that the cutest girls study at MIT and write something about themselves in the description. Help Bryce&nbsp;and write a program that selects from the <code class="language-python">girls</code> list those that fit the criteria and displays their names.</p> 
  <p>Here's an example of the dating app's list:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">girls = [
  {"name": "Ashley", "education": "Harvard", "age": 21, "about": "I like drawing circles"},
  {"name": "Daisy", "education": "MIT", "age": 28, "about": ""},
  {"name": "Maria", "education": "MIT", "age": 21, "about": "Adore traveling and Data Science"},
  {"name": "Stacy", "education": "Harvard", "age": 28, "about": ""},
  {"name": "Kate", "education": "Harvard", "age": 21, "about": "Don't write me if your IQ is lower than mine"},
  {"name": "Leyla", "education": "MIT", "age": 19, "about": "Do not write me that the cat is not bread, please"}]</code></pre> 
  <p>The output, in this case, should be printed as a string with the girls' names separated by a comma and a&nbsp;space: <code class="language-python">Maria, Leyla</code>.</p>
